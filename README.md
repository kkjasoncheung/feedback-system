# Work in progress

# Anonymous Issue and Feedback Submission System
This application is created with the MEAN stack. (MongoDB, Express, Angular, NodeJS). The purpose of this application is to allow anonymous submission of issues/feedback.

## Getting started
To get started, first clone the repo. <br> 

Once you have the repo, `cd` to `/mean-app/backend` and install dependencies with `npm i`. Once all dependencies are installed, execute `node .` to start the API.<br>
Now we want to start the application. <br>

To start the application, `cd` to `/mean-app/frontend` and install dependencies with `npm i`. Once all dependencies are installed, execute `ng serve` to start the Angular application. <br>
Now navigate to `localhost:4200` in your browser and you will be able to interact with the application. <br>

Issues will be stored in a local MongoDB instance in the database called `my_database` and collection name `issues`.
